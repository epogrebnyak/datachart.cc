Exchange rate
=============
- Daily graph shows inverse relationship between ruble exchange rate and Brent oil price.
- There are several historic trajectories, differing at ruble/oil elasticity and exchange rate levels.
- End of March 2017 datapoints are on a lower band of historic trajectory: ruble is much stronger than before
  given the oil current prices.
